This file describes the history of the MATLAB implementations of
the iterative templates project.

Version 1.1: Released August 2006.
   
   1) Corrected errors:

      a) gmres: Unused 'resid' changed to 'error'.

   2) Initialization of all variables and arrays.
   
      a) Arrays initialized en mass, so some deletions below those.
   
      Interesting discussion at 
           http://www.codecomments.com/archive381-2005-10-669759.html.
   
   3) Random number generation:
   
      a) wathen.m:
   
         i)  Changed from rand() to randn().
         ii) Default is uniform distribtion, so deleted that explicit setting.
   
   4) Added workspace (to avoid temporary internal allocation within iteration, 
        e.g. for storing matrix-vector product). Justification: Larger workstation 
        memory lets us solve larger problems: conserve space or time? We chose 
        performance/time to solution.
   
   5) Added tester for individual algorithms.

   6) Corrected typos:
   
      a) gmres: End of file comment claims "converged"; changed to "No convergence".
   
   7) Source comments.
  
      a) More descriptive.
      b) Re-formatted.
      c) Corrected.

   8) Some other minor formatting and internal naming changes.
   
   9) Modified README file to reflect these changes where appropriate.
